# Special Thanks

There are a large number of people who made Ramaze possible by their ongoing
efforts in the world of open source and by encouraging and helping me.

This list is by no means a full listing of all these people, but I try to
get a good coverage despite that.

I would like to thank:

* Yukihiro Matsumoto a.k.a matz

  For giving the world Ruby and bringing fun back into programming.

* Zed Shaw a.k.a. zedas

  For developing Mongrel, Ramaze started out as a simple Hello World based on
  that awesome server.

* Christian Neukirchen a.k.a chris2

  For building rack, which is just what the numerous web-developers had
  anticipated and which will, with no doubt, change the world.

* Pistos

  For continious encouragment and building the first real webpage on Ramaze. His
  bugreports were invaluable.

* Jim Weirich

  For Rake, which lifts off a lot of tasks from the shoulders of every
  developer who uses it.

* Thomas Sawyer a.k.a Trans

  Dragging me deep into the rabbit-hole and showing me how awesome Ruby truely
  is through his work on facets, ratchets and tons of other projects.

* George Moschovitis a.k.a gmosx

  For his tremendous efforts in the Nitro/Og framework, which is a source of
  steady inspiration for Ramaze and brought me to Ruby in the first place.

* Rob Levin a.k.a. lilo

  He founded the most excellent Freenode IRC-network, where the most important
  channels for rubyists are located (as is #ramaze).  May he rest in peace.

* Loren Segal

  For creating YARD. Without YARD we'd still be stuck using rdoc.

* The guys (and gals) in the various channels on Freenode.

  As the people are way too many to be listed, here the channels that I call my
  online home. All the people in there deserve special thanks for getting me
  hooked to Ruby and providing their help in a friendly and patient manner:

  * \#nitro
  * \#ruby-de
  * \#ruby-lang
  * \#rubyforce

I'd also like to thank the following people for contributing to the guide:

* [Stas Su»ôcov](https://github.com/stas)
* [John Pagonis](https://github.com/pagojo)
